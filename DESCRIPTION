Description: Simulation results detailed in Esarey and Menger (2019) <doi:10.1017/psrm.2017.42>
    demonstrate that cluster adjusted t statistics (CATs) are an effective method
    for correcting standard errors in scenarios with a small number of clusters.
    The 'mmiCATs' package offers a suite of tools for working with CATs. The
    mmiCATs() function initiates a 'shiny' web application, facilitating
    the analysis of data utilizing CATs, as implemented in the cluster.im.glm()
    function from the 'clusterSEs' package. Additionally, the pwr_func_lmer()
    function is designed to simplify the process of conducting simulations to
    compare mixed effects models with CATs models. For educational purposes, the
    CloseCATs() function launches a 'shiny' application card game, aimed at enhancing
    users' understanding of the conditions under which CATs should be preferred
    over random intercept models.
