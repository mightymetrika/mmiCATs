#' Deal Cards to CloseCATs Game Grid
#'
#' This internal function deals cards to a 2 x 2 grid for the CloseCATs game.
#' The game involves a deck of cards, where cards are dealt to both the computer
#' and the player. The matrix format of the game grid is such that column 1 is
#' for the computer, and column 2 is for the player. The first row of cards
#' contributes to the random slope variance, and the second row contributes to
#' the covariance between the random slope and the random intercept.
#'
#' @param deck A dataframe representing a deck of cards. If not provided, a
#'    shuffled deck is generated using `mmcards::i_deck()` and
#'    `mmcards::shuffle_deck()`. The deck should contain at least 2*n cards.
#' @param n The number of players. It defines the number of columns in the grid.
#'    Each player, including the computer, will be dealt two cards.
#'
#' @return A matrix representing the game grid with dealt cards. Each cell of the
#'    matrix contains a card dealt to either the computer (column 1) or the player
#'    (column 2).

#' Column Swap in CloseCATs Game Grid
#'
#' This internal function performs a column swap in the CloseCATs game grid.

#'    of players (including the computer). Each cell of the matrix contains a card.
#' @param swap_in_col The column number where the swap should be performed. If
#'    this parameter is NULL or not equal to 2, no action is taken. The default
#'    value is NULL. Typically, this parameter should be set to 2 to perform a
#'    swap for the player's column.

#' @param N Number of observations.
#' @param reps Number of replications for the power analysis.
#' @param alpha Significance level for the power analysis.
#' @param n_time Number of time points.

#' @param cov_is_factor Factor to adjust the covariance between the random intercept
#'    and slope.
